        It has taken me a long time to find the tech industry but I am so glad I
        have.
        <br />
        <br />
        I graduated with a BSc (hons) in Business Studies and Psychology in 2010
        and have since travelled a lot of the world whilst working in a number
        of interesting roles, volunteering, exploring, and learning as I go.
        Working as a driver guide in Scotland upon my return kept my curious and
        adventurous mind busy - it was wonderful to share my knowledge with
        passengers from every country of the world as I led them around my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I worked in a care home, completed a
        masters at the University of Edinburgh in Psychology of Mental Health,
        achieving a distinction, and joined taster sessions in software
        development. This led me to joining SheCodes workshops, where we work
        with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and also to my discovery of data
        analysis. I have now completed an incredibly interesting (and fun!) 14
        week intensive course in data analysis with CodeClan in Edinburgh,
        Scotland. Whilst there, I worked mostly in R whilst learning to clean
        datasets, analyse them in a number of ways, and present our findings on
        dashboards and during presentations. I also gained experience of working
        with SQL and Python and am excited for what the future may hold for me.
